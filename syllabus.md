## Course Description

This practice-based course introduces the fundamentals of user interface and interaction design. Students will engage in an iterative design process that starts with domain research and identifying user needs, and ends with designing and prototyping novel interfaces that address the users and tasks identified through research. The class will explore interaction design in a broad range of contexts and applications including both screen-based and non-traditional interfaces.

Through a series of case studies and hands-on projects, students will learn the critical importance of user interface design as the expression of a holistic user-centered design process. The class format will include lectures, case studies, student presentations, discussions of readings and in-class design exercises. The format is very hands-on with assignments that focus on problems that are typical of those you would encounter in the professional world. Students walk away with a portfolio-quality project that exhibits their understanding of UX/UI best practices with an emphasis on designing for the user.

## Readings & Software
There is no textbook for this class, required readings will be posted through Canvas.

We will utilize the Adobe Creative Suite extensively - Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, Premiere and more. You are ***strongly*** encouraged to have the Creative Suite loaded on your own computer. There are laptops available to borrow through TAM for class. To utilize this resource, **you must inform me of your laptop need prior to class** so that I can bring you a computer (our classroom is in a different building than the laptop storage).

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. Students are allowed **three absences** after which their final grade will be reduced by 10% for each additional absence. Extreme lateness and leaving early counts as 1/3 of an absence. You are responsible for all material and announcements made in class. Do not expect your instructor to catch you up for classes you’ve missed -- that’s your responsibility. Critique days are required; an absence that day will impact your grade for that project.

***ALL absences fall under these three absences*** (this includes minor illnesses and injuries, oversleeping, vacations, job interviews, ski-days, family obligations and situations, etc.). In extreme situations such as major illnesses, death in the family (or close friends), religious observances (see below), or school related absences, please talk or email me *before* your absence.

## Participation
This is an extremely participatory course. You are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. Be cognizant of how you interact in class discussions. If you find yourself commenting more frequently than most other people in the class, step back and give others a chance to contribute (even if you have something to say). If you tend to hesitate to join discussions, challenge yourself to jump in. Additionally, I encourage you to utilize the blogs as a way to connect with your classmates and share your ideas.

**A portion of your final semester grade is based on participation**. If you consistently come to class prepared, you are guaranteed to receive a C in this category. Full credit for Participation is reserved for those who go far above and beyond.

## Critiques
I take critiques very seriously. It will affect your grade negatively if you do not show up for critique. Work is expected to be completed prior to the critique, do not attempt to finish your project during critique, have everything you need prepared, tested and ready to present. Student computers will be shut off and full participation is expected when projects are being presented.

## Communication
You must use your colorado.edu email account for this course - all class correspondence must go through this address.  Please check your email and the class website regularly.

Assignment submissions, discussions, and grading will all use the Canvas course tools system.

## Grading
Students will be assessed on conceptual ideas, technical skills, critical thinking, documentation, participation and attendance. Projects will be assessed on conceptual thought, creativity, originality and aesthetic qualities, experimentation and use of creative engineering solutions.*Work must be presented on the date it is due.*

If you turn in all your work on time (and if it is satisfactorily completed), and if you attend class and participate, you are ensured a C. A’s and B’s are reserved for students who excel beyond average and competent work. Individual projects that are turned in late will result in the grade being lowered for that project. Feedback through the form of critique is also essential; absence from any of the class critiques will result in a drop of one letter grade for that assignment.

**I do not accept late work.**

*Points will be allocated based on the following distribution pattern:*

***You are required to earn a C letter grade or higher in order to continue course work in the TAM program.***

## Course Content
The instructor reserves the right to show a broad range of course materials, some of which assume the audience to be adult in age and demeanor. Should a student feel offended by something they have seen or heard, it would appreciated, but not required, to stay to be part of the dialogue to offer your perspective. However if the student feels that they cannot stay, they are welcome to leave the classroom as discretely as possible.

## Freedom of Speech
This class is held in an academic university setting and due to the inherent nature of the internet and broad range of topics that your project work will explore it is inevitable that we will come across issues dealing with politics and religion. My role during such discussions will be a facilitator, a mediator, and as impartial as humanly possible. All students are encouraged to participate in open discussion and academic discourse.

## UNIVERSITY POLICIES
A full list of CU’s academic policies can be found online at [colorado.edu/policies](http://www.colorado.edu/policies).

## Honor Code
All work/ideas/code must be original and created for this class. All code should be written from scratch by you - meaning that although some code is repeatable you should never copy and paste code from other sources and then find and replace your content into it. In this course, you will be working extensively with Open Source hardware and software. ***You must appropriately credit and cite the resources that you use in your projects, including all Open Source tools.***

All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). The [Student Honor Code](https://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-honor-code-policy) can be found online.

If you fail to meet a guideline by accident, we’ll discuss the situation without taking it to the Honor Council. But if I discover willful intent on your part, I’m obligated to report that to the Honor Council, which has the authority to enforce non-academic corrective action. I retain the authority to enforce academic sanctions, which will range from an F on the project to an F in the course, depending on the severity of the breach of trust.

## Classroom Behavior
Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran’s status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. Full details about the University's policy on [Student Classroom and Course-Related Behavior](https://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior) can be found online.

## Accommodation For Disabilities

## Religious Rights
Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. More information can be found online about the University policy regarding the [Observance of Religious Holidays](https://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams). If you will be missing any classes in order to observe religious holidays, please inform your instructor of these dates at the beginning of the semester.

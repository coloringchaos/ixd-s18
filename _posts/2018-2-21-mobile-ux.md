In this project, you will create a very simple mobile application that fulfills a user need. You will engage in a prototyping and ideation process that will eventually result in a tested and verified low fidelity mockup.  

You will be evaluated on a set of deliverable that detail the research and development process of your mobile experience. Your deliverable must include the following:

**Project Description:** <br>Describe your user research, the purpose of your mobile experience, and the user goals. This page should include primarily written content, although you may choose to include graphics or visual typography where you feel it is appropriate.

**Persona:** <br>This should be the same [persona](/ixd-s18/personas) that you worked on previously. You are welcome to modify it if your concept has evolved, although you should be working with the same user throughout this project. Formatting of your persona should be consistent with the rest of your document.

**Experience Diagrams & Sketches:**<br>Design at least one experience diagram that communicates the the overall journey or narrative of your app. You could create a journey map, an empathy or experience map, a flow diagram, a tree or gantt diagram, or an association map. Include early sketches that contributed to the development of your concept. Clean up and polish your sketches in photoshop or illustrator.

**Interaction Framework / IA:**<br> Develop a blueprint of your interactive experience that explains the content and structure of your app. This graphics focuses solely on the content of your app and how it will be structured.

**Paper Prototypes:**<br>Prototype your full mobile experience using paper. Create a paper mockup of every screen in your app using paper, stick notes, notecards, etc. For more detail about how to do this, watch [Paper Prototyping](https://www.lynda.com/User-Experience-tutorials/UX-Design-Techniques-Paper-Prototyping/534422-2.html).

**Wireframes / Low-Fidelity Mockups**:<br>Develop digital wireframe mockups of every screen of your experience.

## Blog Post

You must format your blog post in the order outlined above, starting with a project description and ending with your low-fidelity mockups. Include a short description and graphics for each step of your process.

*Image and graphics absolutely must be high quality.*

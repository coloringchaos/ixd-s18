As your final screen-based interface design project, you will create a fully designed UI mockup of your mobile app experience. The deliverable for this project will be a polished concept mockup that communicates the purpose of the application and depicts fully designed, static screens of your interface.

Design a simple concept deck with three designed pages that introduce the app, demonstrate key features and functionality, and communicate a cohesive visual language. Use a purposeful color palette that is consistent throughout your designs. Demonstrate your concept by rendering app screens using mobile device mockup templates.

## Requirements

Design your pages in 16:9 format, with the intention that these pages would be included as part of a pitch deck.

Your concept deck must include at least 4 fully designed screens of your mobile application.


## Deliverables

Bring print outs of your three pages to class (printed single sided). Also submit your 4-page pdf as a single file on Canvas.

***This project is worth 200 points and is due on Thursday, April 12th.***

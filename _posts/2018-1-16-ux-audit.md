This exercise challenges you to thoughtfully analyze the experience of using a digital product or service. In this assignment, *you are the user* - and you should thoroughly document absolutely everything that is relevant to your experience.

Choose a product or service that is contingent on a technical or digital element. Focus on selecting something that has a descent level of complexity, that has a range of selections or customizable features. You should also choose something that you are interested and excited about using, something targeted towards your interests or skills.

## Goals & Expectations
Before engaging with the product or experience, **write down** what your expectations are. What is your goal? How long do you expect it will take? What is your attitude going into this experience? Do you think it's going to be easy or hard? What prior knowledge do you have that is relevant to this experience? What is the context - where are you, who are you with, etc..? Feel free to get creative about how you outline these expectations.

## Experience
Use the product or service. Document **every** step of the process. Take photos, screenshots, or video to capture the experience. Depending on what you choose, it may be helpful to have someone else there to help capture the experience.

Focus on analyzing the *digital product* as it relates to your end-goal. In many situations, there may be other humans involved, and those humans can introduce all kinds of complexity - this is important - but don't let this be the focus. Your analysis should be largely on the on the product experience as it relates to your objective.

## Reflections & Analysis
Starting on sticky notes (or a big piece of paper), create a diagram of what you did. Consider creating an affinity map to categorize your experience. Or create a mind-map and explore how aspects of the experience are connected. How did you feel throughout the experience? Consider the emotional journey - can you map this out on a timeline? Get creative with how you analyze and decipher this experience, and consider how you can generate media content to explain your experience with others.

Construct two graphics or media elements that analyze your journey. Generate these in the design software of your choice, pulling from your existing skill set to create something that helps you to analyze and explain the experience. Use these graphics to identify both moments of insight and pain points for you in this experience. Get creative!

## Documentation
Document this exercise thoroughly to your blog. You should craft your blog post as a step-by-step explanation of the experience, emphasizing media elements to communicate your insights. *The intention is **not** to have a really long post about your experience, but to have a thorough and communicative explanation*. Write your blog post like a case study.

You will be evaluated on the insights and quality of your audit, including both written and visual content.

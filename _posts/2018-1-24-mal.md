## Conduct an Interaction Audit

Prior to your visit to the Media Archeology Lab, familiarize yourself with the technology your group chose to explore. Who were the users? What were their goals? What was the intended context or environment of this technology? What was unique or new about it? Who developed the technology and what was their story? What was the reaction by the general public?

During your visit to the Media Archeology Lab, you will have time to learn about and explore the device(s) that your group chose. Explore what kinds of **tasks** you can accomplish with it. How does it feel to use the technology? What is your impression of the overall design?

Thoroughly explore your technology (and document it!), and critically assess what works well and what falls short. Consider the technology *both* in context of when it was originally released, and also from your 2018 perspective. Has this technology been influential? What can we learn from it?


## Presentation

With your group, craft a 12 minute presentation that shares the story of your technology or device. Using rich media elements (graphics, photos, videos, etc..), explain your experience using this technology and walk your audience through some tasks that you engaged in. Provide a critique of the interaction overall, including both hardware, software and design elements.

Because this is a design class, you will be evaluated on how your presentation *looks* in addition to it's content. Design your slides with intention! You may need to build informational graphics for your presentation that will aid in explaining the technology or your assessment of it.

Group 1 will present in class on Tuesday, February 13th

Group 2 will present in class on Thursday, February 15th

## Blog Documentation

Individually, write a summary of your experience visiting the Media Archeology Lab. Post about the technology you explored and what your insights were. Think of the blog post as a shortened version of your presentation, adapted for the blog format. Be sure to include images, video, graphics or other visual media that communicates the experience. Also, share a link to your presentation.

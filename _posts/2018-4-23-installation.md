Design a concept for a non-traditional interface or interactive experience. Create something that engages users in physical space, and focus on how the concept integrates into the environment. The concept does not need to be contingent on user input, but it should be dynamic in that it changes over time. You might choose to make something useful, informational, artistic, collaborative, experiential, etc. Be creative and push yourself to think outside of the box!

I suggest working in groups of 2 or 3.

## Choosing a site
If your concept is site-specific, I strongly suggest choosing a location that you can *actually* visit - i.e. a site in Boulder or Denver. This is highly preferable because you can conduct a thorough site audit, and are able to capture your own photographs of the space. If your context is more general, or not based on a specific location, you should still conduct a rigorous study of the context.

## Concept Presentation

Develop a concept presentation that thoroughly communicates your idea. This presentation should be a comprehensive overview that explains the context, content, and concept. Focus on developing a visually striking, media rich presentation that easily explains the purpose and experience of your vision.

Use any skills you have to generate a minimum of 3 visual representations of the concept:

**Full Context Rendering** - Communicate the full experience in context.

**Hero Shot** - Demonstrates how it works or when it would be used. This allows someone to picture themselves in the experience. *(hint - this should include a person / people!)*

**Interaction Diagram or Schematic** - Show how it works.

If you feel there are better ways than this to visually communicate your idea, check with your instructor about an alternative to the requirements above. In some cases it might be more appropriate to make an animation, a video mockup, or a scale model as a way to visually communicate the idea.  

Your mockups should be visually cohesive. Choose your typography, colors, and visual style before creating renderings to ensure that the designs are consistent throughout your presentation.

## Blog Post

In your blog post, include the media from your presentation in the body of the post. Also, include at least 1 strong paragraph explaining each: the site you choose (context), the informational material related to your idea (the content), and the purpose and vision of the experience (concept).


## Deliverables

We will have in-class project presentations and critique on Thursday, May 2nd.

***Final project is due end of day Sunday, May 6th***
